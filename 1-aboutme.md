### My story

I started my journey in the world of data engineering driven by curiosity and a desire to **turn raw data into real value**. My experience spans across:

- **Data ingestion** from various sources (APIs, databases, files)
- **ETL workflows** that process millions of records daily
- Working with **distributed systems** to ensure scalability and performance

I'm currently on a mission to master cutting-edge data technologies and help organizations make better, data-driven decisions.

When Iâ€™m not engineering data, you can find me learning new tools, experimenting with **LLMs**, or just playing **Valorant** for fun.
